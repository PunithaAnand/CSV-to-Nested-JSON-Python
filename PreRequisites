Download and install the Ananconda Package as per instructions below:

https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-windows
Or
Spyder Notebook:
https://pypi.org › project › spyder-notebook

I find Anaconda package to be useful for my other projects. But, for this script Jupyter or Spyder notebooks are sufficient.

Enjoy!
